2+2 = 4

Test Driven Development (TDD) practice -
write down the test cases before writing the codes

1. user will provide 2 input. find the division of the input.

6 / 2 = 3

7 / 3 = 2

8 / 0 = exception

@RunWith
@Test
Mockito -  When /Then
Assert - AssertEquals


Integration - Pending

Regression - Application Behaviour

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)

Gherkins -
