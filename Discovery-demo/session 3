Swagger
---------------------------------
Swagger is a tool for API documentation.

Let’s start with the annotation on the class itself:

@Tag - Groups endpoints together, by their name. If no tag information is provided by a class and its methods, then a tag named after the class is used. You can also define a description of the tag to describe the overall functionality of a group of endpoints.
Now onto the GET endpoint, below I have expanded on the two annotations with the most impact:

@Operation - Adds details about what the endpoint does, including some properties to achieve this.

summary - The summary (or title) of an endpoint.
description - The description of the endpoint.
tags - What tags to group the endpoint under. You don’t have to specify an array here if there is a single tag; writing tags = "People" also works.
responses - An array of @ApiResponses that details what the endpoint can return, allowing you to show what happens on successful requests as well as unsuccessful or erroneous requests.

@ApiResponse - Provides more information on what an endpoint returns. By filling in a number of its properties, users will better understand your API.

description - The name or description of the endpoint.
responseCode - The response code that is returned.
content - Allows you to specify what media types can be returned along with an example of the response body by using @Schema. In the example above, it causes Swagger to display JSON representation of the Person class.

@Parameter - Include more information about a request parameter.

description - The description of the parameter.
