Setup vault process

1. download ,unzip and update PATH variable with vault folder access
2. create a file called vaultConfig.hcl and add the following entry
storage "file" {
	path= "./vault-data"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address = "127.0.0.1:8200"
  tls_disable =1
}

disable_mlock=true

3. open a command prompt run below to start vault server

Initial Root Token: hvs.OJfQ99zuAKs59mTQsAJJQJbG

Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated root key. Without at least 3 keys to
reconstruct the root key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
