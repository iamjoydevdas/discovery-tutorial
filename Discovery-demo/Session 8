1. Feign Client
2. Fallbacks
3. Rest Api validations

1. Feign client
---------------------------

producer - /product

consumer -

RestTemplate = host + uri + method + protocol

FeignClient -
Both producer and consumer need to be registered under EurekaServer
in producer - (DemoMod1)
            - create the /product rest api
in consumer - (NewMod)
            - add dependency -openFeign
            - add @Feign interface

2. Fallback - What if the producer is down?
       consumer will fail
       Hixtrix support

       you need to write some fallback methods.
       1. feign:
            hystrix:
              enabled: true

       2. write a fallback class

3. Rest Api validations
when you are sending some POJO via request body
student pojo
name = " "

@NotNull
@NotBlank
@Regex

@Valid
